# Types of penetration test
> - Before selecting a suitable provider, it’s important to be familiar with the types of pen test available, as engagements vary in focus, depth and duration. 

#### Common ethical hacking engagements include:
- [Internal/External Infrastructure Penetration Testing](https://www.redscan.com/services/penetration-testing/network-internal-external/)
  - An assessment of on-premise and cloud network infrastructure, including firewalls, system hosts and devices such as routers and switches. 
  - Can be framed as either an internal penetration test, focusing on assets inside the corporate network, or an external penetration test, targeting internet-facing infrastructure. 
  - To scope a test, you will need to know the number of internal and external IPs to be tested, network subnet size and number of sites.

- [Wireless Penetration Testing](https://www.redscan.com/services/penetration-testing/wireless/)
  - A test that specifically targets an organisation’s WLAN (wireless local area network), as well as wireless protocols including Bluetooth, ZigBee and Z-Wave. 
  - Helps to identify rogue access points, weaknesses in encryption and WPA vulnerabilities. 
  - To scope an engagement, testers will need to know the number of wireless and guest networks, locations and unique SSIDs to be assessed.

- [Web Application Testing](https://www.redscan.com/services/penetration-testing/web-application-testing/)
  - An assessment of websites and custom applications delivered over the web, looking to uncover coding, design and development flaws that could be maliciously exploited. 
  - Before approaching a testing provider, it’s important to ascertain the number of apps that need testing, as well as the number of static pages, dynamic pages and input fields to be assessed.

- [Mobile Application Testing](https://www.redscan.com/services/penetration-testing/mobile-application-testing/)
  - The testing of mobile applications on operating systems including Android and iOS to identify authentication, authorisation, data leakage and session handling issues. 
  - To scope a test, providers will need to know the operating system types and versions they’d like an app to be tested on, number of API calls and requirements for jailbreaking and root detection.

- [Build and Configuration Review](https://www.redscan.com/services/penetration-testing/build-and-configuration-review/)
  - Review of network builds and configurations to identify misconfigurations across web and app servers, routers and firewalls. 
  - The number of builds, operating systems and application servers to be reviewed during testing is crucial information to help scope this type of engagement.

# Types of penetration testing
> - The list below outlines the most popular penetration testing types as well as the information commonly requested by pen test providers to help scope an assessment. 
> - Pen tests vary in focus, duration, depth and secrecy, so it’s important to ensure that any details supplied are correct in order to receive an accurate quotation.

## [Network Penetration Testing](https://www.redscan.com/services/penetration-testing/network-internal-external/)
- An assessment of internal and external network infrastructure designed to test on-premise and cloud networks, firewalls, system hosts, and devices such as routers and switches.
  - Information required to scope a network pen test:
    - • Number of external IPs to be tested and number of those that are live
    - • Number of internal IPs and internal hosts to be tested
    - • Subnet size of network(s)
    - • Number of physical locations

## [Wireless Penetration Testing](https://www.redscan.com/services/penetration-testing/wireless/)
- A test of an organisation’s wireless local area network (WLAN) and/or wireless protocols, including Bluetooth, ZigBee and Z-Wave. Helps to identify rogue access points, weaknesses in encryption and WPA vulnerabilities.
  - Information required to scope a wireless pen test:
    - • Number of wireless networks to be tested
    - • Whether guest WiFi is included
    - • Number and locations of sites
    - • Number of unique SSIDs

## [Web Application Testing](https://www.redscan.com/services/penetration-testing/web-application-testing/)
- A test of websites and custom web applications delivered over the internet, seeking to identify issues resulting from weaknesses in design, coding and development practices.
  - Information required to scope a web app test:
    - • Number and type of web applications to be tested
    - • Whether test will be authenticated
    - • Preference for onsite or remote testing
    - • Number of static and dynamic pages
    - • Number of user input fields

## [Mobile Application Testing](https://www.redscan.com/services/penetration-testing/mobile-application-testing/)
- Testing of mobile applications across mobile operating systems such including Android, iOS, Windows and Blackberry, to identify issues with authentication, authorisation, data leakage and session handling.
  - Information required to scope a mobile app test:
    - • Number and type of mobile apps to be tested
    - • Operating system eg. iOS, Android, Windows, BlackBerry
    - • Minimum version of operating system required to run application(s)
    - • Whether app communicates with a server and number of API calls
    - • Requirements for jailbreak/root detection bypass testing

## [Build and Configuration Review](https://www.redscan.com/services/penetration-testing/build-and-configuration-review/)
- Review of network builds and configurations to identify misconfigurations across web and app servers, routers and firewalls.
  - Information required to scope a build and configuration review:
    - • Number and location of build(s) in question
    - • Operating system eg. Windows, Linux, Unix
    - • Number of application servers/services to be reviewed alongside build
    - • Possibilities for providing remote access
