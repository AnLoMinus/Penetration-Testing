# Types of penetration test
- [Internal/External Infrastructure Penetration Testing](https://www.redscan.com/services/penetration-testing/network-internal-external/)
  - An assessment of on-premise and cloud network infrastructure, including firewalls, system hosts and devices such as routers and switches. 
  - Can be framed as either an internal penetration test, focusing on assets inside the corporate network, or an external penetration test, targeting internet-facing infrastructure. 
  - To scope a test, you will need to know the number of internal and external IPs to be tested, network subnet size and number of sites.

- [Wireless Penetration Testing](https://www.redscan.com/services/penetration-testing/wireless/)
  - A test that specifically targets an organisation’s WLAN (wireless local area network), as well as wireless protocols including Bluetooth, ZigBee and Z-Wave. 
  - Helps to identify rogue access points, weaknesses in encryption and WPA vulnerabilities. 
  - To scope an engagement, testers will need to know the number of wireless and guest networks, locations and unique SSIDs to be assessed.

- [Web Application Testing](https://www.redscan.com/services/penetration-testing/web-application-testing/)
  - An assessment of websites and custom applications delivered over the web, looking to uncover coding, design and development flaws that could be maliciously exploited. 
  - Before approaching a testing provider, it’s important to ascertain the number of apps that need testing, as well as the number of static pages, dynamic pages and input fields to be assessed.

- [Mobile Application Testing](https://www.redscan.com/services/penetration-testing/mobile-application-testing/)
  - The testing of mobile applications on operating systems including Android and iOS to identify authentication, authorisation, data leakage and session handling issues. 
  - To scope a test, providers will need to know the operating system types and versions they’d like an app to be tested on, number of API calls and requirements for jailbreaking and root detection.

- [Build and Configuration Review](https://www.redscan.com/services/penetration-testing/build-and-configuration-review/)
  - Review of network builds and configurations to identify misconfigurations across web and app servers, routers and firewalls. 
  - The number of builds, operating systems and application servers to be reviewed during testing is crucial information to help scope this type of engagement.
